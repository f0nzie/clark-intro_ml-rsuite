	abstract = {The amount of readily available on-line text has reached hundreds of billions of words and continues to grow. Yet for most core natural language tasks, algorithms continue to be optimized, tested and compared after training on corpora consisting of only one million words or less. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different learning methods on a prototypical natural language disambiguation task, confusion set disambiguation, when trained on orders of magnitude more labeled data than has previously been used. We are fortunate that for this particular application, correctly labeled training data is free. Since this will often not be the case, we examine methods for effectively exploiting very large corpora when labeled data comes at a cost.},

	abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach
             conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given
             stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data
             mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the
             almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant
             theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a
             large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in
             theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can
             be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative
             alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to
             use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence
             on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},
